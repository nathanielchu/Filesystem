The design problem chosen was crash testing. Compile design.c inside QEMU
(e.g. gcc -o design design.c) and run it (e.g. ./design) to see a
demonstration of a possible incorrect state. In this case, a file's block
is deallocated/unassigned, but the filesystem crashes before the file size
is changed. When the file is read again, the incorrect file size causes
the filesystem to attempt to access a nonexistent block, resulting in an
error.
